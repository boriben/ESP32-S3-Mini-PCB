# ESP32-S3-Mini-PCB
I had a s3 mini module laying around, so I decided to design a board for it. Now I have even more s3 minis laying around :D
(still waiting for MHF4 to MHF4 cables from Aliexpress... I should not have used this module with edge SMA. Maybe will revise board to use bare chip and route RF to edge SMA instead of using niche cable...)
I learned a lot from this project!
